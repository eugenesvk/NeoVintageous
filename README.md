## About this fork of NeoVintageous

NeoVi18nt extends NeoVintageous plugin for Sublime Text by adding:
  - User events on mode change, e.g, set your "exit Insert mode" command to hold<kbd>i</kbd> to avoid typo-prone or inconvenient key sequences by setting an `isNV‚ìò` to `1` variable via Karabiner Elements (macOS), and sending <kbd>‚éã</kbd> when it's `1`
  - Internationalization support of:
    + :sparkles: non-QWERTY/non-Latin layouts based on custom user `keymap` dictionary in `User/NeoVintageous.sublime-settings` (see [example config](https://github.com/eugenesvk/NeoVintageous/blob/master/NeoVintageous.sublime-settings)). Requires manually running `NeoVintageous: Generate non-QWERTY keymap` command to convert default NeoVintageous keybinds to use this keymap
    + :sparkles: non-Latin maps in `.neovintageous`, e.g., `noremap —Ü b` to move back by word when a Cyrillic layout is on (does not work with modifier keys since Sublime Text doesn't report non-Latin keys in key combos, see [this ST issue](https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/issues/5980))
  - :sparkles: better configuration file format `NeoVintageous.kdl` (see [example](./NeoVintageous.help.kdl)) with:
    + Fewer quotes (and in the future v2 version with even fewer quotes):
      ```
       plugin    {  surround    {  punctuation_marks    ‚Äò="‚Äò‚Äô"    ‚Äú="‚Äú‚Äù"    ‚Äπ="‚Äπ‚Ä∫"   ¬´="¬´¬ª" ;};}
      "plugin" : { "surround" : { "punctuation_marks":{"‚Äò":"‚Äò‚Äô", "‚Äú":"‚Äú‚Äù", "‚Äπ":"‚Äπ‚Ä∫","¬´":"¬´¬ª"}} },
      ```
    + Inline comments:
      ```
      punctuation-alias "clear"/*clear defaults d=")" B="}" r="]" a=">" }*/\
                                                 d="(" f="[" g="‚Äò" h="‚Äú"
      ```
    + Support for raw strings so you don't need to escape anything:
      ```
       upper 	r#"l;'\"
      "upper"	: "l;'\\",
      ```
    + Shorter general config option names without the `neovintageous_` prefix (`default_mode "normal"` instead of `"vintageous_default_mode" : "normal",`
    - BUT automatic reload on file change isn't supported, use `NeoVintageous: Reload config` command manually
  + :sparkles: support for importing other config files
    ```
    #import (keybind)"NeoVintageous.key.kdl"
    /*‚Üë or ‚Äòimport‚Äô to import ‚Üë file name relative to this main config file
    group values‚Üë in ‚Äòkeybind{}‚Äô, so the file itself can include only top-level ‚Äòkey command‚Äô lines
    */
    ```
  + :sparkles: human-readable format for setting keyboard shortcuts
    `(nv)d "MoveByWordsBackward" // understandable command name`
    instead of `.neovintageousrc`'s
    `nnoremap d b` why do you need to remember that `b` moves by words backwards if you never use it?
    `vnoremap d b "b=MoveByWordsBackward` oh, and you can't even add a comment on the same line to clarify it
    And the whole `noremap` doesn't need to be repeated on every single line
    + command repeat count in keybinds: `(‚ìÉ)d (#4)"MoveByBigWordsBackward"` (or `‚Ññ` `#` `‚åó` `c` `n` `√ó` `‚ãÖ` prefix) will move by 4 Words
    + list of commands is executed as a single chain without the need to specify `chain` command (`(‚ìÉ)q "MoveByBigWords" "MoveByBigWords"`)
    + `chain` argument to add node children as a sequence of commands for the same keybind (in case they need to set their own properties)
      ```kdl
      (‚ìÉ)q "MoveByBigWords" "chain" {
        ‚Üì/*node names are ignored*/ "MoveByBigWords"
        - r#":"command":"move","args":{"by":"words","forward":true,"extend":true}<CR>"#
      }
      ```
    + template variables to, e.g., import the same keybind with a single modifier variation per mode to make them toggle relative lines with <kbd>[</kbd> in Normal mode and <kbd>‚éà</kbd><kbd>[</kbd> in Insert mode
      `NeoVintageous.keyB.kdl` file (`‚Äò‚Äô` are default template variable pre/pos delimiters)
      ```kdl
      (‚Äòm‚Äô)"‚Äòipre‚Äô[‚Äòipos‚Äô" ":set invrnu<CR>"
      ```
      `NeoVintageous.key.kdl` file that will import ‚Üë
      ```kdl
      #import "NeoVintageous.keyB.kdl" m=(var)"‚ìÉ" ipre=(var)""    ipos=(var)""  //  (‚ìÉ)[
      #import "NeoVintageous.keyB.kdl" m=(var)"‚ìò" ipre=(var)"<C-" ipos=(var)">" //  (‚ìò)<C-[>
      ```
    + group keybinds under a single mode without having to repeat mode's name in each keybind
      ```kdl
      (‚ìÉ)my_normal_group {
        d "MoveByBigWordsBackward"
        f "MoveByBigWords"
      }
      ```
    + execute Sublime Text commands by writing arguments in a `prop=value` format
      ```kdl
      (‚ìÉ)r (subl)"move" by="words" forward=true extend=false
      //- r#":"command":"move","args":{"by":"words","forward":true,"extend":false}<CR>"#
      // ! but this is NOT suitable for chains since prop=val in KDL do not maintain position vs. arguments, so to execute multiple Sublime Text commands with arguments you'd still need to "chain them"
      (‚ìÉ)t "chain" {
        - (#5subl)"move" by="words" forward=true extend=false
        - (#5subl)"move" by="words" forward=true extend=true
      }
      // ! also, this doesn't work for nested arguments, those still require pasting the full json snippet
      ```
  - Support nicer configuration even in the old format:
    + :sparkles: support for raw Sublime Text commands in user config without having to convert their names or arguments (or just the command names by adding extra `:` prefix)
    + :sparkles: rudimentary foundations to support custom key symbols in user config, e.g., `noremap ‚áü w` to move by word with a <kbd>‚áü</kbd>PageDown key
  - a few other extensions:
    + :sparkles: surround: allow users to configure marks, mark aliases, when to append an extra space
    + :sparkles: surround: option to not seek the next set brackets if current text isn't enclosed in one ‚Äî `‚éÄa(b)` with surround  delete will result in:
      - `‚éÄa(b)` if `seek_forward` is `false` (default)
      - `‚éÄab`   if `seek_forward` is `true`
    + :sparkles: surround: option to maintain cursor position on text edits, e.g., adding `'` to `my_‚éÄword` (‚éÄ denotes cursor position) will leave cursor at the same spot in the new `'my_‚éÄword'` while previously it moved it to the first inserted punctuation `‚éÄ'my_word'`
    + :sparkles: abolish: option to maintain cursor position on case changes, e.g., converting `se‚éÄView‚éÄSel_‚éÄReverse` to upper case (‚éÄ denotes cursor position) will leave cursor at the same spot in the new `SE_‚éÄVIEW_‚éÄSEL_‚éÄREVERSE` while previously it moved it to the beginning of the word `SE_VIEW_SEL_REVERSE`
  - and other changes:
    + :sparkles: show a popup with a count indicator<br/>before![before](./doc/img/count_popup_before.png) ![after](./doc/img/count_popup_after.png)after
    + :sparkles: nowrap alternative to tab switch Ex commands (`tabnextnowrap`/`tabpreviousnowrap`)
    + :sparkles: allow user to set values of various indicators:
      + for `ls` command, e.g., replace `+` modified file mark with `üñâ` similar to how a modified tab is marked
      + for `registers` command, e.g., replace `l` for linewise with `‚îÅ`

| Operator&#8209;pending&nbsp;mode   | Like Normal mode, but after an operator command has start, and Vim is waiting for a `{motion}` to specify the text that the operator will work on.
| Command-line mode<br>Cmdline mode  | `:`, `/`, `?`, `!`
| Multiple-cursor mode               | `CTRL-n` or `gh`

## neovintageousrc

(see [Settings](Settings) re. the new consolidated config file that also includes initialization commands)

A file that contains initialization commands is typically referred to as a "vimrc" file. In NeoVintageous, this file is called "neovintageousrc". Each line in the neovintageousrc file is executed as an Ex command at startup.

To edit the neovintageousrc file, follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Palette: `Command Palette ‚Üí NeoVintageous: Open neovintageousrc file`.

2. Make the necessary changes to the file.

3. To apply the changes, reload the neovintageousrc from the Command Palette: `Command Palette ‚Üí NeoVintageous: Reload neovintageousrc file`.

## Key mapping

### `<Leader>` `mapleader`

To define a mapping which uses the "g:mapleader" variable, the special string
"`<Leader>`" can be used.  It is replaced with the string value of
"g:mapleader".  If "g:mapleader" is not set or empty, a backslash is used
instead. Example:

```vim
noremap <Leader>A  oanother line<Esc>
```

Works like:

```vim
noremap \A  oanother line<Esc>
```

But after:

```vim
let mapleader=,
```

It works like:

```vim
noremap ,A  oanother line<Esc>
```

Note that the value of "g:mapleader" is used at the moment the mapping is
defined.  Changing "g:mapleader" after that has no effect for already defined
mappings.

### `<LocalLeader>` `maplocalleader`

`<LocalLeader>` is just like `<Leader>`, except that it uses "maplocalleader"
instead of "mapleader".  Example:

```vim
let maplocalleader=,
noremap: <LocalLeader>A  oanother line<Esc>
```

### Map commands

There are commands to enter new mappings, remove mappings and list mappings.

See [map-overview](#map-overview) for the various forms of "map" and their relationships with modes.

`{lhs}`   means left-hand-side.

`{rhs}`   means right-hand-side.

| Commands | Description
| -------: | :----------
| :no[remap]&nbsp;`{lhs}`&nbsp;`{rhs}` <br>:nn[oremap]&nbsp;`{lhs}`&nbsp;`{rhs}` <br>:ino[remap]&nbsp;`{lhs}`&nbsp;`{rhs}` <br>:vn[oremap]&nbsp;`{lhs}`&nbsp;`{rhs}` <br>:xn[oremap]&nbsp;`{lhs}`&nbsp;`{rhs}` <br>:snor[emap]&nbsp;`{lhs}`&nbsp;`{rhs}` <br>:ono[remap]&nbsp;`{lhs}`&nbsp;`{rhs}` | Map the key sequence `{lhs}` to `{rhs}` for the modes where the map command applies.  Disallow mapping of `{rhs},` to avoid nested and recursive mappings.  Often used to redefine a command.

### Special arguments

`FileType <type>` can be used to limit a mapping to specific file types. It must appear right after the command, before any other arguments. This feature is specific to Sublime Text.

#### Mapping Specific File-Types

File type specific mappings are supported by the `FileType` keyword that accepts a comma-delimited list of file-types.

**Example:** Map `gd` to the `lsp_symbol_definition` command for \*.go and \*.html files.

```vim
nnoremap FileType go,html gd :LspSymbolDefinition<CR>
```

### Mapping and modes

There are seven sets of mappings

- For Normal mode: When typing commands.
- For Visual mode: When typing commands while the Visual area is highlighted.
- For Select mode: like Visual mode but typing text replaces the selection.
- For Operator-pending mode: When an operator is pending (after "`d`", "`y`", "`c`", etc.).
- For Insert mode.  These are also used in Replace mode.

Special case: While typing a count for a command in Normal mode, mapping zero is disabled.  This makes it possible to map zero without making it impossible to type a count with a zero.

#### map-overview

Overview of which map command works in which mode.  More details below.

| COMMAND   | COMMAND | MODES
| :-------- | :------ | :----
| :noremap  | :unmap  | Normal, Visual, Select, Operator-pending
| :nnoremap | :nunmap | Normal
| :inoremap | :iunmap | Insert <br>:warning: Insert mode mappings are very limited. Very few keys are mappable out-of-the-box, but you can configure any key to be mappable. This may be improved in a future release.
| :vnoremap | :vunmap | Visual and Select
| :xnoremap | :xunmap | Visual
| :snoremap | :sunmap | Select <br>:warning: Currently represents Multiple-cursor mode; this may change in a future release. The multiple-cursor mode is likely to get its own dedicated mode. Probably :mnoremaap?
| :onoremap | :ounmap | Operator-pending

Same information in a table:

|          Mode  | Norm | Ins | Vis | Sel | Opr |
|:---------------|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [nore]map      | yes  |  -  | yes | yes | yes |
| n[nore]map     | yes  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |
| i[nore]map     |  -   | yes |  -  |  -  |  -  |
| v[nore]map     |  -   |  -  | yes | yes |  -  |

| s[nore]map     |  -   |  -  |  -  | yes |  -  |
| o[nore]map     |  -   |  -  |  -  |  -  | yes |

| Command   | Command  | Normal | Visual+Select | Operator-pending
| :-------- | :------- | :----- | :------------ | :---------------
| :noremap  | :unmap   | yes    | yes           | yes
| :nnoremap | :nunmap  | yes    | -             | -
| :vnoremap | :vunmap  | -      | yes           | -
| :onoremap | :ounmap  | -      | -             | yes

### Mapping special keys

In Vim, certain keys hold special significance. You can find a useful list of these special keys, along with their notations and codes, in the Vim documentation's [key-notation and key-codes section](https://vimhelp.org/intro.txt.html#key-notation).

**Examples**

| Key        | Meaning
| :--------- | :------
| `<tab>`    | tab
| `<space>`  | space
| `<lt>`     | less-than `<`
| `<bslash>` | backslash `\`

### Mapping Ex Commands

**Example:** Map CTRL-l to the :nohlsearch command to stop the highlighting for the 'hlsearch' option.

```vim
noremap <C-l> :nohlsearch<CR>
```

For a full list of supported ex commands, please refer to our [roadmap](https://github.com/NeoVintageous/NeoVintageous/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).

### Mapping Sublime Text Commands

Sublime Text commands are mappable. The command must be PascalCase and the parameters must be space separated.

Note: Sublime Text commands are PascalCased for the purpose of distinguishing them from Ex commands, which always start with a lowercase letter. This choice is due to an implementation detail.

**Example:** Map `,f` to the `show_overlay` command with arguments `{"overlay": "goto", "text": "@"}`

```vim
nnoremap ,f :ShowOverlay overlay=goto text=@<CR>
```

**Where do these commands come from?**

When you run a command in Sublime Text, you can inspect the console log to discover the command and arguments needed to map it.

1. Console Logging: View console logging by navigating to `Menu ‚Üí View ‚Üí Show Console`.

2. Command and Input Logging: Enable command and input logging by running the following commands in the console:

   ```
   sublime.log_commands(True)
   sublime.log_input(True)
   ```

For example, let's say you want to map "Goto Symbol" command above. Run the command, e.g., "Menu ‚Üí Goto ‚Üí Goto Symbol" command and Sublime Text will print the following in the console:

```
command: show_overlay {"overlay": "goto", "text": "@"}
```

### Mapping Super-Keys

Super keys, also known as the Windows key or Command key (‚åò) on Mac, are denoted as `<D-...>`.

For example, to map the `<D-i>` combination to the `goto_symbol_in_project` command, add the following configuration to your neovintageousrc file:

```vim
nnoremap <D-i> :GotoSymbolInProject<CR>
```

With this mapping in place, pressing the Super key (Windows key or Command key on Mac) together with the 'i' key will trigger the `goto_symbol_in_project` command in NeoVintageous.

Please note that this example demonstrates mapping the `<D-i>` combination for illustrative purposes. You can map other Super-key combinations or any desired key combinations to different commands based on your needs and preferences.

### Mapping Case-Sensitivity

All keys are case-sensitive in Sublime Text. This means that `<D-i>` and `<D-I>` are treated as two distinct key events, allowing you to map actions to both.

**Example:** Map "Goto Symbol in Project" and "Goto Symbol in File" using case-sensitive mappings

To map the Super-key (Windows key or Command key on Mac) together with the 'i' key to the "Goto Symbol in Project" command, add the following configuration to your neovintageousrc file:

```vim
noremap <D-i> :GotoSymbolInProject<CR>
```

To map the Super-key together with the 'Shift' and 'i' keys (`<D-I>`) to the "Goto Symbol in File" command, add the following configuration to your neovintageousrc file:

```vim
noremap <D-I> :ShowOverlay overlay=goto text=@<CR>
```

With these mappings in place, you can now use both `<D-i>` and `<D-I>` combinations to trigger different commands in NeoVintageous.

Feel free to modify and customize these mappings based on your preferences and workflow. The case-sensitivity of the keys allows you to create distinct mappings for different actions, providing you with greater flexibility in your keybindings.

### Mapping for Toggling the Side Bar

To toggle the side bar using your preferred mapping (in this example, `<leader>d`), first, add the following configuration to your neovintageousrc file:

```vim
let mapleader=,
nnoremap <leader>d :Neovintageous action=toggle_side_bar<CR>
```

Next, open the Command Palette and navigate to `Preferences: Key Bindings`. Add the following JSON key binding to be triggered when the side bar has focus:

```json
{
    "keys": [",", "d"],
    "command": "neovintageous",
    "args": {
        "action": "toggle_side_bar"
    },
    "context": [
        { "key": "control", "operand": "sidebar_tree" }
    ]
}
```

Please note that the provided example uses `<leader>d` as the mapping, but you can customize it to your preferred mapping by modifying the `<leader>` part and updating the key binding to match your leader and preferred key. For instance, if your preferred mapping is `<leader>t`, you can modify the mapping as follows:

1. Update the mapping in your neovintageousrc file:

```vim
let mapleader=,
nnoremap <leader>t :Neovintageous action=toggle_side_bar<CR>
```

2. Open the Command Palette and navigate to `Preferences: Key Bindings`. Add the following JSON key binding to be triggered when the side bar has focus, using your preferred key combination:

```json
{
    "keys": [",", "t"],
    "command": "neovintageous",
    "args": {
        "action": "toggle_side_bar"
    },
    "context": [
        { "key": "control", "operand": "sidebar_tree" }
    ]
}
```

By making these modifications, you can now use your preferred mapping (e.g., `<leader>t`) to easily toggle the side bar while using NeoVintageous in Sublime Text. This flexibility allows you to choose a keyboard combination that suits your workflow and personal preferences.

### Mapping for Revealing the Side Bar

To reveal the side bar using your preferred mapping (in this example, `<leader><leader>`), first, add the following configuration to your neovintageousrc file:

```vim
let mapleader=,
nnoremap <leader><leader> :Neovintageous action=reveal_side_bar<CR>
```

Next, open the Command Palette and navigate to `Preferences: Key Bindings`. Add the following JSON key binding to be triggered when the side bar has focus:

```json
{
    "keys": [",", ","],
    "command": "focus_group",
    "args": {
        "group": 0
    },
    "context": [
        { "key": "control", "operand": "sidebar_tree" }
    ]
}
```

With this setup, you can now use the specified key bindings to easily toggle and reveal the side bar while using NeoVintageous in Sublime Text.

Please note that the provided example uses `<leader><leader>` as the mapping, but you can customize it to your preferred mapping by modifying the `<leader>` part and updating the key binding to match your leader and preferred key. See [Mapping for Toggling the Side Bar](#mapping-for-toggling-the-side-bar) for a more detailed example.

### Mapping Capslock to Escape

NeoVintageous cannot directly remap the CapsLock key; however, you can achieve this remapping at the operating system level. For instance, on Ubuntu, you can map the CapsLock key to Escape using a tool called `gsettings`. Follow these steps to make the remapping:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Run the following command to map CapsLock to Escape using `gsettings`:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options "['caps:escape']"
```

After executing this command, the CapsLock key will act as the Escape key in your system. This means that when using NeoVintageous or any other application, pressing CapsLock will have the same effect as pressing the Escape key.

Please note that the specific method to remap keys might vary depending on your operating system or desktop environment. Be sure to check the documentation or forums related to your OS for any variations or additional steps.

## Options

The list below includes all options, presented with their full names and corresponding abbreviations, where applicable. You can use either form interchangeably. Certain options act as proxies to Sublime Text settings, meaning they utilize the underlying Sublime Text setting. Modifying the option will consequently alter the corresponding Sublime Text setting.

| Option                          | Type    | Default                                         | Description
| :------------------------------ | :-------| :-----------------------------------------------| :----------
| `'autoindent'`<br>`'ai'`        | String  | `auto_indent` <br>sublime setting               |
| `'belloff'`<br>`'bo'`           | String  | `''`                                            | Valid values: `''` and `'all'`.
| `'equalalways'`                 | Boolean | On                                              |
| `'expandtab'`<br>`'et'`         | Boolean | `translate_tabs_to_spaces` <br>sublime setting  |
| `'hlsearch'`<br>`'hls'`         | Boolean | On                                              | When there is a previous search pattern, highlight all its matches. See also: `'incsearch'`. When you get bored looking at the highlighted matches, you can turn it off with `:nohlsearch`.  This does not change the option value, as soon as you use a search command, the highlighting comes back.
| `'ignorecase'`<br>`'ic'`        | Boolean | Off                                             |
| `'incsearch'`<br>`'is'`         | Boolean | On                                              | While typing a search command, show where the pattern, as it was typed so far, matches.  The matched string is highlighted.  If the pattern is invalid or not found, nothing is shown.  The screen will be updated often.<br> Note that the match will be shown, but the cursor will return to its original position when no match is found and when pressing `<Esc>.`  You still need to finish the search command with `<Enter>` to move the cursor to the match.<br> When `'hlsearch'` is on, all matched strings are highlighted too while typing a search command. See also: `'hlsearch'.`
| `'list'`                        | Boolean | `draw_white_space` <br>sublime setting          | Useful to see the difference between tabs and spaces and for trailing blanks.
| `'magic'`                       | Boolean | On                                              |
| `'menu'`                        | Boolean | On                                              |
| `'minimap'`                     | Boolean | On                                              |
| `'modeline'`<br>`'ml'`          | Boolean | On                                              |
| `'modelines'`<br>`'mls'`        | Number  | 5                                               |
| `'number'`<br>`'nu'`            | Boolean | `line_numbers` <br>sublime setting              | Print the line number in front of each line.
| `'relativenumber'`<br>`'rnu'`   | Boolean | `relative_line_numbers` <br>sublime setting     | Show the line number relative to the line with the cursor in front of each line. Relative line numbers help you use the `count` you can precede some vertical motion commands (e.g., `j` `k` `+` `-`) with, without having to calculate it yourself. Especially useful in combination with other commands (e.g., `y` `d` `c` `<` `>` `gq` `gw` `=`).
| `'scrolloff'`<br>`'so'`         | Number  | `scroll_context_lines` <br>sublime setting      |
| `'shell'`                       | String  | `$SHELL` or `"sh"`, Win32: `"cmd.exe"`          |
| `'sidebar'`                     | Boolean | On                                              |
| `'smartcase'`<br>`'scs'`        | Boolean | Off                                             |
| `'spell'`                       | Boolean | `spell_check` <br>sublime setting               |
| `'statusbar'`                   | Boolean | On                                              |
| `'tabstop'`<br>`'ts'`           | Number  | `tab_size` <br>sublime setting                  |
| `'textwidth'`<br>`'tw'`         | Number  | `wrap_width` <br>sublime setting                |
| `'winaltkeys'`<br>`'wak'`       | String  | `menu`                                          |
| `'wrap'`                        | Boolean | `word_wrap` <br>sublime setting                 | This option changes how text is displayed.  It doesn't change the text in the buffer, see `'textwidth'` for that.<br> When on, lines longer than the width of the window will wrap and displaying continues on the next line.  When off lines will not wrap and only part of long lines will be displayed.  When the cursor is moved to a part that is not shown, the screen will scroll horizontally.
| `'wrapscan'`<br>`'ws'`          | Boolean | On                                              |

## Customize Search Highlighting Colors

You can customize the colors for search highlighting in Sublime Text.

To tailor these colors, follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Palette by using the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).

2. Type and select: `UI: Customize Color Scheme`.

3. Within the color scheme file, define distinct styles for various search highlighting scopes:

   - `neovintageous_search_inc`: This scope is used for highlighting the current search incrementally as you type.
   - `neovintageous_search_cur`: This scope is used for highlighting the current search term.
   - `neovintageous_search_occ`: This scope is used for highlighting all occurrences of the search term.

Here's an example of defining styles for these scopes:

```json
{
    "rules": [
        {
            "scope": "neovintageous_search_inc",
            "background": "#a1efe4",
            "foreground": "#272822"
        },
        {
            "scope": "neovintageous_search_cur",
            "background": "#a1efe4",
            "foreground": "#272822"
        },
        {
            "scope": "neovintageous_search_occ",
            "background": "#e6db74",
            "foreground": "#272822"
        }
    ]
}
```

Feel free to adjust the color values (`"#a1efe4"`, `"#e6db74"`, etc.) according to your preferences.

Personalizing search highlighting colors improves the visual distinction of results in your code, enhancing your overall coding experience.

### Highlighted Yank

Highlighted Yank is a plugin designed to highlight the yanked region in Sublime Text.

When new text is yanked, the old highlighting is automatically deleted. This ensures that the highlighting remains relevant to the most recent yanked text. Similarly, when former lines are edited, the highlighting is cleared to prevent shifting the position of the highlighting.

You can customize the highlighted yank duration and style using the following settings:

- `vintageous_highlighted_yank_duration`: This setting allows you to configure the duration for which the yanked region will be highlighted. You can set the duration according to your preferences.

- `vintageous_highlighted_yank_style`: This setting allows you to customize the style of the highlighted yank region. You can modify the background and foreground colors to suit your color scheme.

#### Customize Highlighted Yank Colors

To tailor the colors of highlighted yanks to your preference, you can create a color scheme override using the following steps:

1. Open the Command Palette by using the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).

2. Open the Command Palette: `UI: Customize Color Scheme`.

3. Add the following styles using the "highlightedyank" scope, and adjust the background and foreground colors as desired:

```json
{
    "rules": [
        {
            "scope": "highlightedyank",
            "background": "#e6db74",
            "foreground": "#272822"
        }
    ]
}
```

By customizing the colors of highlighted yanks, you can make yanked regions more visually distinctive and ensure they align with your preferred color scheme, enhancing your editing experience in the Sublime Text editor.

### Input Method :rocket: :new: <small>Since v1.32</small>

Automatically switch the input method when entering and exiting Insert Mode.

Any third-party program can be used to switch input methods. Below are some examples.

Below, you'll find instructions for installing and using input method switchers on various operating systems.

| vintageous_auto_switch_input_method               | false                     | Boolean   | Enable automatic switching of input methods.
| vintageous_auto_switch_input_method_default       | ""                        | String    | The default input method to be used.
| vintageous_auto_switch_input_method_get_cmd       | ""                        | String    | The full path to the command used to retrieve the current input method key.
| vintageous_auto_switch_input_method_set_cmd       | ""                        | String    | The full path to the command used to switch input methods, where `{im}` is a placeholder for the input method key.

The `{im}` argument in the configurations below represents a command-line option that will be passed to the input switcher command, indicating the desired input method for switching. If you're using an alternative program for input method switching, you should incorporate a similar option into the configuration. For instance, if the alternate program's syntax for switching input methods is `my-program -s im`, then the `vintageous_auto_switch_input_method_set_cmd` should be set to `/path/to/my-program -s {im}`. This ensures compatibility with different input method switching tools.

#### Linux:

1. **Install an Input Method Switcher**:

### Markology :rocket: :new: <small>Since v1.32</small>

Markology displays marks associated with the current line in the gutter. You can disable this feature by modifying the setting `vintageous_show_marks_in_gutter`.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Palette: `Preferences: NeoVintageous Settings`.
2. Add the following JSON configuration:

```json
{
    "vintageous_show_marks_in_gutter": false
}
```

By adjusting this setting, you can control whether marks are displayed in the gutter for the current line.

#### Customize Markology Mark Colors

If you wish to personalize the color of the marks displayed by Markology, you can follow these steps to create a color scheme override:

1. Open the Command Palette by using the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).

2. Type and select: `UI: Customize Color Scheme`.

3. Add the following JSON configuration, adjusting the color as desired:

```json
{
    "rules": [
        {
            "scope": "neovintageous.mark",
            "foreground": "yellow"
        }
    ]
}
```

By customizing the color of the marks, you can ensure they are visually distinct and align with your preferred color scheme, providing you with a more tailored and visually appealing editing experience in Sublime Text.

### Multiple Cursors

NeoVintageous provides multiple cursor support in normal mode and visual mode. This feature allows you to work with multiple cursors simultaneously, making repetitive editing tasks more efficient.

**Normal and Visual Mode Commands**

| Command                       | Description
| :---------------------------- | :----------
| `<C-n>` or `gh`               | Start multiple cursor.
| `<C-n>` or `n` or `j`         | Add next match.
| `<C-x>` or `q` or `l`         | Skip next match.
| `<C-p>` or `N` or `k` or `Q`  | Remove current match.
| `<M-n>` or `\\A`              | Select all matches.
| `<Esc>` or `J` or `<Tab>`     | Quit and enter normal mode.
| `v` or `<Tab>`                | Enter normal mode.
| `gH`                          | Select all search occurrences (`/`, `?`, `*`, `#`).

You can now use visual commands such as `c`, `I`, `x`, and `y`, which work without any issues.

You could also go to Normal mode by pressing `v` and use normal commands there.

At any time, you can press `<Esc>` to exit back to regular Vim.

To change the behaviour of `<Esc>`, you can set the `vintageous_multi_cursor_exit_from_visual_mode` setting. When set to false, pressing a quit key (e.g., `<Esc>` or `J`) in multiple cursor visual mode exits to normal mode but keeps the cursors. When set to true, pressing a quit key (e.g., `<Esc>` or `J`) in multiple cursor visual mode exits all multiple cursors.

With the multiple cursor feature, you can speed up your editing workflow by applying commands to multiple locations simultaneously, increasing productivity and convenience.

### Sneak

By default, Sneak is disabled to prevent conflicts with certain Vim commands such as `s`, `S`, `z`, and `Z`. To enable Sneak, follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Palette by selecting `Preferences: NeoVintageous Settings`.
2. Add the following JSON configuration:

```json
{
    "vintageous_enable_sneak": true
}
```

#### Customize sneak mappings

You can customize the default sneak mappings by setting environment variables.

*The necessity to configure these mappings through environment variables, rather than conventional settings, arises from an implementation detail: plugins are loaded during startup, and access to settings is not available at this stage. Resolving this issue will require making significant design adjustments. In the meantime, employing environment variables provides a viable solution.*

The environment variables:

```sh
NEOVINTAGEOUS_SNEAK_MAP_S=s
NEOVINTAGEOUS_SNEAK_MAP_BIG_S=S
NEOVINTAGEOUS_SNEAK_MAP_Z=z
NEOVINTAGEOUS_SNEAK_MAP_BIG_Z=Z
```

**Example:** For Linux users, consider adding the following lines to your `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` file:

```sh
export NEOVINTAGEOUS_SNEAK_MAP_S=s
export NEOVINTAGEOUS_SNEAK_MAP_BIG_S=S
export NEOVINTAGEOUS_SNEAK_MAP_Z=z
export NEOVINTAGEOUS_SNEAK_MAP_BIG_Z=Z
```

Please keep in mind that to activate these changes, you will be required to restart Sublime Text and, in some cases, reboot your system.

**Example:** For Windows users:

You can set environment variables for each user separately through the System Properties dialog box. The steps to do that:

1. Type Windows Key + R to open the "Run" dialog box.
2. Enter "sysdm.cpl" and press the "OK" button. The "System Properties" dialog box will open.
3. Select the "Advanced" tab and press the "Environment Variables..." button. The "Environment Variables" dialog box will open.
4. Select an existing variable in the "User variables" list and press the "Edit..." button to edit it. Or press the "New..." button to add a new variable.
5. After you finished editing variables, press the "OK" button to save the changes.

Please keep in mind that to activate these changes, you will be required to restart Sublime Text and, in some cases, reboot your system.

## F.A.Q.

### Key Presses are Laggy or Slow

If you are experiencing laggy or slow key presses, it could be due to the system configuration. Here are some steps you can take to improve the responsiveness of key presses:

#### On macOS (OSX):

1. Enable Key Repeat:
   If holding down a key like "j" does not repeat the command (a feature of macOS), you can enable key repeat by running this command once at the terminal:

   ```bash
   defaults write com.sublimetext.3 ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
   ```

#### On Ubuntu (GNOME desktop):

1. Configure Keyboard Repeat Interval and Delay:
   You can adjust the keyboard repeat interval and delay using `gsettings`. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard repeat-interval 15
   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard delay 180
   ```

#### On KDE:

1. Adjust Keyboard Delay and Rate:
   For KDE users, you can change the keyboard delay and rate by running the following command:

   ```bash
   systemsettings5 kcm_keyboard
   ```

   This will bring up a window where you can change the 'Delay' and 'Rate' settings as required.

#### On X11 Systems (generic method):

1. Directly Set Keyboard Repeat Rate:
   For X11 type systems, you can directly set the keyboard repeat rate using `xset`. Open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   xset r rate <milliseconds_before_repeating> <repetitions_per_second>
   ```

   For example, to set a 300 milliseconds delay before repeating and a repetition rate of 30 repetitions per second, use:

   ```bash
   xset r rate 300 30
   ```

By adjusting these settings, you can enhance the responsiveness of key presses and improve your typing experience in Sublime Text or any other applications on your system.
