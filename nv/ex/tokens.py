        #   :name (str): The name of the command.
        #   :target (str): The name of the ex command to execute. Defaults to
        #       the name. SHOULD NOT include the prefix "ex_".
        #   :params (dict): Default is {}.
        #   :forced (bool): Indicates if the bang character ! was placed
        #       immediatley after the command. The '!' (bang) character after an
        #       Ex command makes a command behave in a different way. The '!'
        #       should be placed immediately after the command, without any
        #       blanks in between. If you insert blanks the '!' will be seen as
        #       an argument for the command, which has a different meaning. For
        #       example:
        #           :w! name        Write the current buffer to file "name",
        #                           overwriting any existing file.
        #           :w !name        Send the current buffer as standard input to
        #                           command "name".
        #   :addressable (bool): Indicates if the command accepts ranges.
        #   :cooperates_with_global (bool): Indicates if the command cooperates
        #       with the :global command. This is special flag, because ex
        #       commands don't yet support a global_lines argument. It seems
        #       that, in Vim, some ex commands work well with :global and others
        #       ignore :global ranges. However, according to the docs, all ex
        #       commands should work with :global ranges. At the time of
        #       writing, the only command that supports the global_lines
        #       argument is the "print" command e.g. print all lines matching
        #       \d+ into new buffer: ":%global/\d+/print".
